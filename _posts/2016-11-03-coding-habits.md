# My Coding Habits

This is a list of small habits that I make to my self when I do coding.

I mostly write code in C, using Vim or Sublime Text as my primary text editors. So these habits may be applicable only to me and completely nonsense to anyone else.

The list begins:
- In order to remove all compiler warnings from my code, I usually put and `#error` at the end of my code, so the compiler will stop at the `#error` for me to see all the warning from my code above. Fix all those warnings before continue going.
 
- Enable the text editor to display all tab characters, and redundant spaces at the end of each line. I hate redundant spaces and tabs.

(The list will be updated as I grow new habits :D)

Please give your ideas, suggestion and your personal habits in the comment.
