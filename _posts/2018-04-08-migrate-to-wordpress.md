# Announcement: Migrating to Wordpress

Hi!

This site has been inactive for quite a while. Now I'm going to continue writing some more stuffs.

This time, I will migrate the content on this site to my new Wordpress site:

https://lazydevnotes.wordpress.com/

New posts will also be published to the new site. Please check it out!

## Why I migrated to Wordpress?

To put it simply: I can't get Jekyll to work :(

As you know, this site is powered by Jekyll. When I first stated this site, I was able to install Jekyll after a "few" times of trial and error installation. It allows me build the content locally before publishing it to Github. That makes writing process much easier, smoother and more fluent. 

Fast forward to present day, now I can't get Jekyll working again on my machine, no matter how many ways I have tried to install it. (Call me stupid). I'm don't know anything about Ruby, NodeJs, etc., and the effort need to spend to figure this thing out is simply not worth it for me. (Call me lazy). 

Without Jekyll running locally, it would be annoying to write any content with sophisticated format. I'm writing this announcement in plain Markdown, which is okay since it is just text. But writing something with more complex structure, without Jekyll to verify locally before publishing to Github, would likely to be a lot of shredded commits and changes.

So I choose a simple alternative which is Wordpress.

Please check my [new site](https://lazydevnotes.wordpress.com/) out!
